### Model Description

Demographic model for four modern human populations: YRI, CEU, CHB, JPT and KHV. Model and data from Jouganous et al. 2019. Model with sudden growth of ancestral population size, followed by split into population YRI and common population of CEU, CHB and JPT, which experience bottleneck and split with exponential recovery of all populations - first formation of CEU population followed by split of ancestal population of CHB and JPT. Migrations between populations are symmetrical.
